# How to prepare egusi soup.(Melon soup) 
Egusi soup is a tasty meal made from dry Egusi seeds (Melon Seeds). It has its origin among The Yorubas of south-western Nigeria. Today, it is considered a national delicacy prepared throughout the country and beyond

To prepare Egusi, you need:

- 1 cup dry egusi seeds (ground). 
- 1/2 cup palm oil
- 1 handful of washed bitter leaf.
- 1/4 cup ground crayfish(optional) 
- 1 small tomato(optional). 
- 4 medium-sized scotch bonnets. 
- chili pepper(ground). 
- 2 medium-size onions. 
- Chicken, Beef, or Fish. ( you can use meat or fish or both). 
- Salt. 
- 2 cubes of seasoning. 
  
## Preparation  

1. Place the ground melon seeds in a bowl and soak with water.
   Don't add too much water, you only want the water to soak through, not for the egusi to become watery. While you are doing this,  break apart any mold that might have formed as a result of the egusi and water coming together. This will leave it feeling smooth and less likely to form lumps while cooking. 

2. Place the scotch bonnets, onion, and tomato in a
   blender and blend. If you need to add water, add as little as possible because you will need to dry it out later. 

3. Cut one onion into fine bits. 
   
4. Wash the bitter leaves.
 
   __How to wash bitter leaves for egusi soup.__

  - Place the fresh bitter leaves into a big bowl(big enough for both of your hands to fit into it and still have some room). 
   - Add a little water. 
   - Clunch a handful of leaves in both hands, leaving some parts peeking out of your clenched fists. Start rubbing the leaves in your hands together, mimicking the movements you make when you wash your clothes. 
   - After a few minutes, you will notice the water turn green and become foam-like. 
   - Continue for a few minutes before draining the water and adding a new one. 
   - Repeat this process until the leaves lose most of its bitter taste.
   Stop washing when you can taste the leaves without scrunching up your face. For this soup, If you wash out all the bitterness, it losses its uniqueness. 
   (still not sure when to stop? When you start cooking, add your bitter leaves in batches and taste to see how it comes out. After a few trials, you will find the perfect taste for you.) 

5. Cook your meat with salt, onion and 1 seasoning cube. 
   
6. Once cooked, you can use the meat or fry with palm oil or vegetable oil. 
   
7. If what you have is fresh fish, fry with palm oil before using it. 
   If you are using dry fish, there is no need to fry. 
   
## Cooking directions. 

1. Place a dry pot on the fire and add palm oil. Set the stove to mid-low heat. 
   
2. Once the oil heats up enough, add your chopped onion. 
   
4. Allow to fry until light brown and add the blended tomato and pepper. Stir well and leave to fry until all the water has evaporated. Before this happens, you need to stir at intervals. 

5. Add your soaked egusi and mix thoroughly. Continue to stir for a few minutes, until 
 well incorporated and you get this caramel-like aroma.

6. If you are using meat, add the meat stock. If the soup is still too thick
   for you, add some water, cover your pot and increase to mid-high heat. Leave to boil for 10 to 15 minutes. 

7. Add your meat, fish, crayfish, Salt, bitter leaves and cover for 10 minutes. 
   
8. Add your seasoning cube, stir well and leave to boil for 5 to 7 minutes. 
   
Your egusi soup is ready! Serve and enjoy with eba, nshima, ugali, semo, amala etc. 
You can also mix your egusi soup with [ogbono soup](/how-to-prepare-ogbono-soup/) before eating. Give both a try and see which you prefer.
