# How to prepare egusi soup. (Melon soup)

Egusi soup is a tasty meal made from dry Melon seeds. It has its origin among The Yorubas of south-western Nigeria. Today, it is considered a national delicacy prepared throughout the country and beyond.

## Ingredients

* 1 cup dry egusi (melon) seeds (ground).
* 1/2 cup palm oil.
* 1 handful of washed bitter leaf.
* 4 medium-sized scotch bonnets.
* chili pepper(ground).
* 2 medium-size onions.
* Chicken, Beef, or Fish. ( you can use meat or fish or both).
* Salt.
* 2 cubes of seasoning.

  ### Optional ingredients
  * 1 small tomato
  * 1/3 ground crayfish
  * Bitter leaves can be replaced with sliced fluted pumpkin leaves.

## Preparation

1. Place the ground melon seeds in a bowl and soak with water.
   Don't add too much water, you only want the water to soak through, not for the egusi to become watery. While you are doing this,  break apart any mold that might have formed as a result of the egusi and water coming together. This will leave it feeling smooth and less likely to form lumps while cooking.
2. Place the scotch bonnets, onion, and tomato in a
   blender and blend. If you need to add water, add as little as possible because you will need to dry it out later.
3. Cut one onion into fine bits.
4. Wash the bitter leaves.

   You can buy already washed bitter leaves from the market or you can wash them on your own.

How to wash bitter leaves.

Bitter leaves are a unique type of vegetable. They are bitter in taste, healthy, and are used in a variety of dishes as well as a lot of home remedies.

Their bitter taste which makes them unique is also a turn of for some. This is mainly because they are unable to properly wash them. Today we are going to look at how to wash the perfect bitter leaves.

Washing bitter leaves for food

Different foods require you to wash bitter leaves in different ways but the overall process is the same. 

There are two main ways of washing bitter leaves.

1. With a blender.
   * Wash the leaves and place in a blender, add some water and blend for one to two minutes.
   * Pour the mix into a bowl and squeeze out the water from the leaves and place in a new bowl. Throw the water you squeezed out away.
   * Add fresh water to the leaves and squeeze for a few minutes before throwing out the water. 
   * This helps get rid of the bitter taste so repeat this process until you get the taste you want.
2. Traditional method.

   This is the traditional method of washing bitter leaves.

* Place the fresh bitter leaves into a big bowl(big enough for both of your hands to fit into it and still have some room).
* Add a little water.
* Clunch a handful of leaves in both hands, leaving some parts peeking out of your clenched fists. Start rubbing the leaves in your hands together, mimicking the movements you make when you wash your clothes.
* After a few minutes, you will notice the water turn green and become foam-like.
* Continue for a few minutes before draining the water and adding a new one.
* Repeat this process until the leaves lose most or all of their bitter taste. 

Tips.

For Egusi soup:

* Stop washing when you can taste the leaves without scrunching up your face. For this soup, If you wash out all the bitterness, it losses its uniqueness. (still not sure when to stop? When you start cooking, add your bitter leaves in batches and taste to see how it comes out. After a few trials, you will find the perfect taste for you.)

**Note.**  People with severe asthma are strongly not advised to prepare this soup following this method because of all the palm oil bleaching involved.
