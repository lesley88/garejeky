3. Just before the stock dries up,  pour in your fried veggies and liver. 
4. Cover and Leave on fire for about 2 to three minutes or until the water completely dries up. 
5. With a spatula/wooden spoon, stir the rice, making sure that everything is evenly mixed. Leave for another one minute and take off the stove.

### Two
1. Pour the chicken stock in a pot and bring to boil
2. Add the parboiled rice and salt. Alow to cook on high heat. 
3. Once the water dries up,  take off the stove .
 
The next step is to fry the rice. you will need to divide the fried vegetables and rice into smaller portions and fry them in batches. The size of your pan and the quantity of your rice would determine how many times this will be done.

4. Place a frying pan on the stove and pour in a portion of fried vegetables. 
5. Next, add some rice and liver. Stir-fry for about two to three minutes and take off the stove. 
6. Repeat this process until all the rice is fried.
 
  Your fried rice is ready.

 For this method, all ingredients are same but the rice is not fried. 
1. Boil the stock and add rice, salt, curry powder, one seasoning cube and cooking oil. Allow to boil for 15/20 minutes. 
2. 5 minutes before the water dries up, pour in your chopped veggies and liver. Cover and allow the water dry up. Stir with a wooden spoon and take off the stove. 
3. Keep the lid over the pot for five to ten minutes.


Your fried rice is ready. 

Serve with moi-moi, salad and/or dodo.(fried plantain) 

_Some persons argue that the last method cannot be called fried rice since no frying is done but its just a matter of preference._
