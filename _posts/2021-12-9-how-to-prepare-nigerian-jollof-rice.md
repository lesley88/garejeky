# How to prepare Nigerian Jollof rice

Jollof rice is undoubtedly Nigeria's most popular rice recipe. It's popular both at home and in parties. It's not only delicious but quick and easy to prepare. 

## Ingredients 

- 3 cups of rice(long grain or short grain that do not stick together.) 
- 2 big fully ripe tomatoes
   
- 4 Fresh pepper (scotch bonnets /habenero) 
-   2 medium sized onions
- 1/4 cup cooking oil (vegetable,groundnut,sunflower etc)
- curry powder(optional)
- Chicken/ beef stock.(if you don't have this, it's ok to use water) 
- Salt
- One or two seasoning cubes 
  
## Preparation 
1. Blend the tomatoes, pepper, onion and set aside. 
2. Bring some water to boil and add the rice(washed). Allow to cook for fifteen minutes and take off the stove. 
3. Pour the rice into a sieve and wash under running water. Afterwards leave in the sieve to drain. 
4. Pour the stock into a sieve to remove small chicken/meat bones that might be in it. 
 
## Cooking directions

1. Place a dry pot on the stove and pour in cooking oil. Allow to heat up and add some chopped onions.
2. Fry until they turn a light brown and add the blended tomatoes and pepper. 
3. stir-fry for two to three minutes and add salt, one seasoning cube, curry powder and fry until the water dries up. (you will need to stir the sauce at intervals.) 
4. Add the stock, stir and allow to boil. (if the stock is not much, you can add some water. You need enough water for the rice to fully cook.) 
5. Once the water starts to boil. Add the parboiled rice but do not stir. Stiring causes the rice to become mushy and burn before it's fully cooked. 
6. Cover and allow to cook for fifteen to twenty minutes or until the rice becomes fully cooked and the water dries up (if the water is drying up and you notice the rice is still hard, you can add a bit more water).
7. Give it a thorough stir and take off the stove.
 
Your jollof rice is ready.

## Variation 
* Some persons like their jollof rice to taste a bit smoky. 
* If you do or you would like to try it out, follow the steps bellow: 
1. Once the rice is fully cooked, leave on the stove and allow to burn for a few minutes (5 minutes should do). Stir and take off the stove.
2.  Leave covered for another 10 to 15 minutes.(leaving it covered for this long helps circulate the toasty flavour)
   
Serve with fried meat/fish/chicken/egg  and moi-moi or dodo(fried ripe plantain.)

## Note

When cooking jollof rice, its best to use a wooden spoon when you need to stir because:
1. it prevents or reduces the chances of your rice burning before it needs to  or before you want it to.
2. if the rice does get burnt, stiring with a wooden spoon only grazes the top of the burnt part. Leaving your rice with a smoky aroma and taste instead of an unpleasant burnt one.
