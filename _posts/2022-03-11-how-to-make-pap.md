Tips. 

Pap is fast and easy to make but some people say its a challenge. Here are some tips to help you make the perfect pal. 

1. Small or medium sized bowls are better for making pap. Using large bowls can often lead to your pap becoming watery. (especially if you haven't yet mastered the act.) 
2. Pour the boiling water steadily over the raw pap. Pouring and stopping often leads to your pap becoming lumpy. 
3. Cover the pap with a lid after it sets. Covering helps trap heat which helps it get rid of any lingering raw taste or smell. Covering also helps it thicken.

## Note
The  easiest pap to make is the one made from corn or millet. 

Pap made from guinea corn is tricky because it can quickly become watery. 

## Extra tips
Here are extra tips for pap made from guinea corn. 

1. Mix the guinea corn pap with as little cool water as possible.
2. Don't take the water off the stove as soon as it starts to boil. Leave it on heat for about two more minutes. 
3. When you start pouring the hot water over the raw pap, mix quickly and stop at the first sign of the pap thickening. Cover for at least five minutes before stiring again. 

## Remedy

If despite your efforts, the pap come out too light or raw, here is what you can do.
You can either 
1. Place a pot or pan on the fire and pour in some water. Allow the water heat up for a few minutes and place the plate of pap on it. 
2. Stir the pap on heat continuously and you will notice it becoming thicker. Take off heat when your desired consistency has been achieved. Or 
3. Place a small pot on low heat and pour in the pap, start stiring immediately until it thickens to the consistency you want.
