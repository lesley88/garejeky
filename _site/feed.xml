Tips.</p>

<p>Pap is fast and easy to make but some people say its a challenge. Here are some tips to help you make the perfect pal.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Small or medium sized bowls are better for making pap. Using large bowls can often lead to your pap becoming watery. (especially if you haven’t yet mastered the act.)</li>
  <li>Pour the boiling water steadily over the raw pap. Pouring and stopping often leads to your pap becoming lumpy.</li>
  <li>Cover the pap with a lid after it sets. Covering helps trap heat which helps it get rid of any lingering raw taste or smell. Covering also helps it thicken.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="note">Note</h2>
<p>The  easiest pap to make is the one made from corn or millet.</p>

<p>Pap made from guinea corn is tricky because it can quickly become watery.</p>

<h2 id="extra-tips">Extra tips</h2>
<p>Here are extra tips for pap made from guinea corn.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Mix the guinea corn pap with as little cool water as possible.</li>
  <li>Don’t take the water off the stove as soon as it starts to boil. Leave it on heat for about two more minutes.</li>
  <li>When you start pouring the hot water over the raw pap, mix quickly and stop at the first sign of the pap thickening. Cover for at least five minutes before stiring again.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="remedy">Remedy</h2>

<p>If despite your efforts, the pap come out too light or raw, here is what you can do.
You can either</p>
<ol>
  <li>Place a pot or pan on the fire and pour in some water. Allow the water heat up for a few minutes and place the plate of pap on it.</li>
  <li>Stir the pap on heat continuously and you will notice it becoming thicker. Take off heat when your desired consistency has been achieved. Or</li>
  <li>Place a small pot on low heat and pour in the pap, start stiring immediately until it thickens to the consistency you want.</li>

They are bitter in taste, healthy, and are used in a variety of dishes as well as a lot of home remedies.</p>

<p>Their bitter taste which makes them unique is also a turn of for some. This is mainly because they are unable to properly wash them. Today we are going to look at how to wash the perfect bitter leaves.</p>

<h2 id="washing-bitter-leaves-for-food">Washing bitter leaves for food</h2>

<p>Different foods require you to wash bitter leaves in different ways but the overall process is the same.</p>

<p>There are two main ways of washing bitter leaves.</p>

<h3 id="1-with-a-blender">1. With a blender.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Wash the leaves and place in a blender, add some water and blend for one to two minutes.</li>
  <li>Pour the mix into a bowl and squeeze out the water from the leaves and place in a new bowl. Throw the water you squeezed out away.</li>
  <li>Add fresh water to the leaves and squeeze for a few minutes before throwing out the water.</li>
  <li>This helps get rid of the bitter taste so repeat this process until you get the taste you want.
    <h3 id="2-traditional-method">2. Traditional method.</h3>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This is the traditional method of washing bitter leaves.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Place the fresh bitter leaves into a big bowl(big enough for both of your hands to fit into it and still have some room).</li>
  <li>Add a little water.</li>
  <li>Clunch a handful of leaves in both hands, leaving some parts peeking out of your clenched fists. Start rubbing the leaves in your hands together, mimicking the movements you make when you wash your clothes.</li>
  <li>After a few minutes, you will notice the water turn green and become foam-like.</li>
  <li>Continue for a few minutes before draining the water and adding a new one.</li>
  <li>Repeat this process until the leaves lose most or all of their bitter taste.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tips">Tips.</h3>

<h4 id="for-egusi-soup">For Egusi soup:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>For Egusi soup, don’t wash out all bitterness from the leaves. Stop washing when you can taste them without scrunching up your face. For this soup, If you wash out all bitterness, it losses its uniqueness. (still not sure when to stop? When you start cooking, add your bitter leaves in batches and taste to see how it comes out. After a few trials, you will find the perfect taste for you.)</li>
</ul>

<em>Season meat with salt, some chopped onion and one seasoning cube.</em> <em>Make sure that your meat has as little water as possible by the time it’s well cooked.</em> <em>Why? That is because this soup needs to be very thick. The leaves and palm oil will give it enough water to Cook.</em></li>

  <li>If you are using heavily smoked fish, add it at the same time you are cooking the stockfish.</li>
  <li>Don’t like spicy food? It’s okay to leave out chilli pepper.</li>

<h2 id="containers-for-cooking">Containers for cooking</h2>

<p>Anyone of:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Aluminum cups/bowls</li>
  <li>Plastic cups/bowls</li>
  <li>Plastic bags</li>
  <li>Plantain or banana leaves</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Wash and soak the beans overnight or for this length of time.</li>
  <li>Remove all peels and blend until smooth. If you soak the beans Long enough, the peels come off easily.</li>
  <li>Pour the bean puree into a large bowl and add all ingredients except the filling. <strong>Ingredients to add</strong> blended tomato, pepper and onions. Nutmeg, cooking oil, salt and stock cube.</li>

    <p><strong>Tips</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The moi-moi texture you want to achieve is one where the mixture is neither too thick nor too light.</li>
      <li>If you don’t have warm water, it’s okay to use cool water, especially if the Moi-Moi quantity is not much.</li>
      <li>Do not use hot water as it will cause the  paste to become lumpy.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Serve small quantity of Moi-Moi paste into any container of your choice. Repeat this process until all the moi moi has been served.</p>

    <p><strong>Tip</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you are not used to cooking with leaves, it’s best to use aluminum or plastic cups. Once leaves are not folded properly, they can unravel.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Into every container of moi moi, add the filling of your choice. (boiled egg, fish etc)
If you are using minced meat, season and cook them before adding to your moi-moi.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="cooking-directions">Cooking directions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Pour some water in a large pot, and place the cups of moi-moi.
Don’t put too much water in the pot, so it does not boil over into the moi-moi when cooking.</li>
  <li>Cover the pot and cook for an hour. While your moi -moi is cooking, open the pot every 10 to 15 minutes and add little quantity of water whenever you notice the water is drying out. This will prevent the Moi-Moi from getting burned.</li>
  <li>Taste to see if your moi-moi is fully cooked. To confirm if your moi moi is ready, either cut out a piece and taste or pierce the inside with a dry object. If it comes out clean, it’s properly cooked.</li>
  <li>Continue cooking for a few more minutes if it’s not properly cooked and take off the fire if and when they are.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Your moi moi is ready.</strong></p>

<h2 id="serving">Serving.</h2>

<p>Serve and enjoy with Fried rice, Jollof rice, Pap, Custard, Oats or simply enjoy on it’s own.</p>

<p><strong>*<em>Note.</em></strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Before you start cooking, taste the moi moi to be sure there is nothing else you are missing. Once you start cooking you cannot add anything else.</li>
  <li>If you are using plastic bags, double and tie them well. This will prevent water from getting inside if one of the bags has a hole you didn’t see.</li>
  <li>When using any container that is plastic, top up the water in the cooking pot frequently.</li>
  <li>If the water gets too low, there is a risk of the containers getting burnt.</li>
  <li>Avoid using banana or plantain leaves to cook if you are not confident you know how to use them.
They can unravel quickly and spoil your efforts if they are not well folded.
If you feel you know how to  but still have some doubts, then tie each of them with a small rope after folding. It will help keep them together.</li>

It’s popular both at home and in parties. It’s not only delicious but quick and easy to prepare.</p>

<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
  <li>3 cups of rice(long grain or short grain that do not stick together.)</li>
  <li>
    <p>2 big fully ripe tomatoes</p>
  </li>
  <li>4 Fresh pepper (scotch bonnets /habenero)</li>
  <li>2 medium sized onions</li>
  <li>1/4 cup cooking oil (vegetable,groundnut,sunflower etc)</li>
  <li>curry powder(optional)</li>
  <li>Chicken/ beef stock.(if you don’t have this, it’s ok to use water)</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
  <li>One or two seasoning cubes</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Blend the tomatoes, pepper, onion and set aside.</li>
  <li>Bring some water to boil and add the rice(washed). Allow to cook for fifteen minutes and take off the stove.</li>
  <li>Pour the rice into a sieve and wash under running water. Afterwards leave in the sieve to drain.</li>
  <li>Pour the stock into a sieve to remove small chicken/meat bones that might be in it.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="cooking-directions">Cooking directions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Place a dry pot on the stove and pour in cooking oil. Allow to heat up and add some chopped onions.</li>
  <li>Fry until they turn a light brown and add the blended tomatoes and pepper.</li>
  <li>stir-fry for two to three minutes and add salt, one seasoning cube, curry powder and fry until the water dries up. (you will need to stir the sauce at intervals.)</li>
  <li>Add the stock, stir and allow to boil. (if the stock is not much, you can add some water. You need enough water for the rice to fully cook.)</li>
  <li>Once the water starts to boil. Add the parboiled rice but do not stir. Stiring causes the rice to become mushy and burn before it’s fully cooked.</li>
  <li>Cover and allow to cook for fifteen to twenty minutes or until the rice becomes fully cooked and the water dries up (if the water is drying up and you notice the rice is still hard, you can add a bit more water).</li>
  <li>Give it a thorough stir and take off the stove.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your jollof rice is ready.</p>

<h2 id="variation">Variation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Some persons like their jollof rice to taste a bit smoky.</li>
  <li>If you do or you would like to try it out, follow the steps bellow:
    <ol>
      <li>Once the rice is fully cooked, leave on the stove and allow to burn for a few minutes (5 minutes should do). Stir and take off the stove.</li>
      <li>Leave covered for another 10 to 15 minutes.(leaving it covered for this long helps circulate the toasty flavour)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Serve with fried meat/fish/chicken/egg  and moi-moi or dodo(fried ripe plantain.)</p>

<h2 id="note">Note</h2>

<p>When cooking jollof rice, its best to use a wooden spoon when you need to stir because:</p>
<ol>
  <li>it prevents or reduces the chances of your rice burning before it needs to  or before you want it to.</li>
  <li>if the rice does get burnt, stiring with a wooden spoon only grazes the top of the burnt part. Leaving your rice with a smoky aroma and taste instead of an unpleasant burnt one.</li>

<h2 id="cooking-directions">Cooking directions.</h2>
<p>Below are three ways you can cook fried rice.</p>
<h3 id="one">One</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Pour the  chicken stock in a large pot and bring to boil. The stock should be enough to fully cook the rice. If the stock is too small, you can add some water.</li>
  <li>To the boiling stock, add your parboiled rice and salt. Leave to cook on high heat.</li>
  <li>Just before the stock dries up,  pour in your fried veggies and liver.</li>
  <li>Cover and Leave on fire for about 2 to three minutes or until the water completely dries up.</li>
  <li>With a spatula/wooden spoon, stir the rice, making sure that everything is evenly mixed. Leave for another one minute and take off the stove.</li>
  <li>Leave the rice covered for ten to fifteen minutes(This improves the taste) and your fried rice is ready.
    <h3 id="two">Two</h3>
  </li>
  <li>Pour the chicken stock in a pot and bring to boil</li>
  <li>Add the parboiled rice and salt. Alow to cook on high heat.</li>
  <li>Once the water dries up,  take off the stove .</li>
</ol>

<p>The next step is to fry the rice. you will need to divide the fried vegetables and rice into smaller portions and fry them in batches. The size of your pan and the quantity of your rice would determine how many times this will be done.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Place a frying pan on the stove and pour in a portion of fried vegetables.</li>
  <li>Next, add some rice and liver. Stir-fry for about two to three minutes and take off the stove.</li>
  <li>Repeat this process until all the rice is fried.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your fried rice is ready.</p>

<h3 id="three">Three</h3>
<p>For this method, all ingredients are same but the rice is not fried.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Boil the stock and add rice, salt, curry powder, one seasoning cube and cooking oil. Allow to boil for 15/20 minutes.</li>
  <li>5 minutes before the water dries up, pour in your chopped veggies and liver. Cover and allow the water dry up. Stir with a wooden spoon and take off the stove.</li>
  <li>Keep the lid over the pot for five to ten minutes.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your fried rice is ready.</p>

<p>Serve with moi-moi, salad and/or dodo.(fried plantain)</p>

<p><em>Some persons argue that the last method cannot be called fried rice since no frying is done but its just a matter of preference.</em></p>

<p>*Turkey stock can also be used.</p>

It’s a delicious meal made from the juice extracted from palm fruits.</p>

<p>Traditionally, the soup is taken with starch, a sticky swallow made from cassava. Today it’s commonly eaten with eba,semovita and other swallow.</p>

<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
  <li>2kg palm fruits</li>
  <li>5 medium size scotch bonnets</li>
  <li>Ground chilli pepper</li>
  <li>2  big onions</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
  <li>2 cubes of seasoning</li>
  <li>Chicken/Meat/Fish</li>
  <li>Ground banga soup spice (optional,)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-choose-the-right-palm-fruits">How to choose the right palm fruits</h2>

<p>In southern Nigeria, there are two main specie of palm fruits.(those am familiar with)</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Native palm fruits:  this specie has smaller seeds and a thin cover.</p>

    <p>The best way to identify them is to pick up a seed and pierce it with your finger or a  semi sharp object. The cover is very thin and your nails would get to the seed quickly.</p>

    <p>When used to prepare banga soup, this variety is sweeter but lighter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Agric palm fruits (Local name) : this one has larger seeds and a thick cover. When pierced, it has more juice flowing out and the inner seed is placed deeper.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If you cook banga soup with this variety, it  will come out very thick but lacking in taste. No matter how much ingredient you add, it will come out tasteless.</p>

<p>Most people combine both, 70 percent native palm fruits and 30 percent agric palm fruits.</p>

<p>I also use only native palm fruits as I don’t like a thick banga soup.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If these names are not familiar, you can identify them by their features.</li>
  <li>Make sure to buy fresh palm fruits.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>

<p>Wash the Banga fruits and put in a pot.</p>

<p>Blend the scotch bonnets with one whole onion.</p>

<p>Wash and boil meat with salt, some chopped onion, and one seasoning cube (don’t add too much water, as you won’t be needing meat stock.).</p>

<h2 id="cooking-directions">Cooking directions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Boil Banga seeds on high heat for one hour or until they are tender. (they are ready when you can easily press down on them with your fingers.)</li>
  <li>Take off the stove and pour in a sieve to drain out the water.</li>
  <li>Transfer to a mortal. (if you don’t have one, you can use a pot or a large bowl(The risk is that they may get damaged with repeated use).</li>
  <li>With a pestle, pound the Banga until the skin separates from the seeds.</li>
  <li>Add some water and mash with your fingers. ( as you continue, you will notice the water get thicker)</li>
  <li>Once the juice is thick enough, pour into another bowl( place a sieve on the new bowl to prevent seeds or shafts falling into the juice.)</li>
  <li>
    <p>Repeat this process until you get all juice from the seeds.</p>

    <p>Make the juice as thick as possible because when you start cooking, it will get lighter before getting thick again. You don’t want to end up with a watery soup or spend hours cooking.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Place a new sieve on a pot and pour in your Banga juice.</li>
  <li>Take out the sieve and place on the stove.</li>
  <li>Add your blended scotch bonnets and chilli pepper. (do this immediately you place the pot on the stove, if left to boil without pepper, it will spill over.)</li>
  <li>Allow to boil for 20 to 30 minutes, depending on how thick you want your soup to be.</li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are using banga soup spice, add at this stage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leave to boil for 5 or 10 minutes, Add your meat, Salt, and one seasoning cube. If you have some chopped onion left, you can add them now,</p>
  </li>
  <li>Boil for another 10 minutes, stir  and take off the stove.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your banga soup is ready. Serve with any swallow of your choice.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you have been cooking this soup for a long time and it’s taking forever to get as thick as you want, serve a small portion and Cook in a smaller pot.</li>
  <li>Banga soup gets thicker with time, it will be much thicker if allowed to stay until the next day.</li>
