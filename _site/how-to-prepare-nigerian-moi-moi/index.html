    "body": "2022/03/11 - Pap is a light dish loved by all age groups and the go-to food for a number of occasions. It it can be enjoyed by babies (more than 6 months old) as well as adults. Raw pap can be made from anyone of corn, guinea corn, millet or a combination of any two of these. You can also combine all three of them if you want. It is the baby food of choice for a lot of African parents because of its many health benefits . For adults, it is commonly eaten at breakfast and dinner with moi moi, akara, beans etc. Preparation time: Cooking: 10mins Ingredients:  Raw pap Cool water.  Hot water SugarOptional ingredients:  Milk CocoaPreparation:  Place some raw pap lumps in a bowl and match with a spoon.  Slowly add some cool water and stir until the spoon can move freely without getting stuckThe quantity of water to add will depend on how thick you want the pap to be. Note that pap gets thicker and increases in size as you make it. Cooking directions:  Place a kettle of water on the fire. Add more water than may seem nessesary at first because pap increases in size once you start adding hot water.  Allow the water boil for a minute or two.  Stir the pap mix again to get rid of any lump that might have started forming again Take the water off the stove and slowling but continuously pour over the pap , while simultaneously stiring it in a circular motion. Continue pouring until it starts to thicken. Stop when it gets to a consistency that you desire.  Cover with a lid and leave to cook for a few minutes. Do not put it on a stove.  Add sugar/honey and milkYour pap is ready Serving: Serve with akara, bread, moi -moi etc. Pap can also be taken on it’s own with sugar and milk but don’t expect it to keep hunger at bay. Tips. Pap is fast and easy to make but some people say its a challenge. Here are some tips to help you make the perfect pal.  Small or medium sized bowls are better for making pap. Using large bowls can often lead to your pap becoming watery. (especially if you haven’t yet mastered the act. ) Pour the boiling water steadily over the raw pap. Pouring and stopping often leads to your pap becoming lumpy.  Cover the pap with a lid after it sets. Covering helps trap heat which helps it get rid of any lingering raw taste or smell. Covering also helps it thicken. Note: The easiest pap to make is the one made from corn or millet. Pap made from guinea corn is tricky because it can quickly become watery. Extra tips: Here are extra tips for pap made from guinea corn.  Mix the guinea corn pap with as little cool water as possible.  Don’t take the water off the stove as soon as it starts to boil. Leave it on heat for about two more minutes.  When you start pouring the hot water over the raw pap, mix quickly and stop at the first sign of the pap thickening. Cover for at least five minutes before stiring again. Remedy: If despite your efforts, the pap come out too light or raw, here is what you can do. You can either  Place a pot or pan on the fire and pour in some water. Allow the water heat up for a few minutes and place the plate of pap on it.  Stir the pap on heat continuously and you will notice it becoming thicker. Take off heat when your desired consistency has been achieved. Or Place a small pot on low heat and pour in the pap, start stiring immediately until it thickens to the consistency you want. "

    "title": "How to Wash Bitter Leaves",
    "body": "2022/03/05 - Bitter leaves are a unique type of vegetable. They are bitter in taste, healthy, and are used in a variety of dishes as well as a lot of home remedies. Their bitter taste which makes them unique is also a turn of for some. This is mainly because they are unable to properly wash them. Today we are going to look at how to wash the perfect bitter leaves. Washing bitter leaves for food: Different foods require you to wash bitter leaves in different ways but the overall process is the same. There are two main ways of washing bitter leaves. 1. With a blender. :  Wash the leaves and place in a blender, add some water and blend for one to two minutes.  Pour the mix into a bowl and squeeze out the water from the leaves and place in a new bowl. Throw the water you squeezed out away.  Add fresh water to the leaves and squeeze for a few minutes before throwing out the water.  This helps get rid of the bitter taste so repeat this process until you get the taste you want.   2. Traditional method. :  This is the traditional method of washing bitter leaves.  Place the fresh bitter leaves into a big bowl(big enough for both of your hands to fit into it and still have some room).  Add a little water.  Clunch a handful of leaves in both hands, leaving some parts peeking out of your clenched fists. Start rubbing the leaves in your hands together, mimicking the movements you make when you wash your clothes.  After a few minutes, you will notice the water turn green and become foam-like.

For this soup, If you wash out all bitterness, it losses its uniqueness. (still not sure when to stop? When you start cooking, add your bitter leaves in batches and taste to see how it comes out. After a few trials, you will find the perfect taste for you. )For Bitter leaf soup::  Ironically, for bitter leaf soup, you have to wash out all traces of bitterness from the leaves. "

Add the fish and cook for 3 to 5 minutes.  Add water leaves, Ugwu leaves, chilli pepper, salt, and one stock cube and cook for five minutes. Your Edikang Ikong is ready.

Before you start cooking, taste the moi moi to be sure there is nothing else you are missing. Once you start cooking you cannot add anything else.  If you are using plastic bags, double and tie them well. This will prevent water from getting inside if one of the bags has a hole you didn’t see.  When using any container that is plastic, top up the water in the cooking pot frequently.  If the water gets too low, there is a risk of the containers getting burnt.  Avoid using banana or plantain leaves to cook if you are not confident you know how to use them. They can unravel quickly and spoil your efforts if they are not well folded. If you feel you know how to but still have some doubts, then tie each of them with a small rope after folding. It will help keep them together. "

    "title": "How To Prepare Banga Soup",
    "body": "2021/11/20 - Banga soup is native to the Urhobos of South Southern Nigeria. It’s a delicious meal made from the juice extracted from palm fruits. Traditionally, the soup is taken with starch, a sticky swallow made from cassava. Today it’s commonly eaten with eba,semovita and other swallow. Ingredients:  2kg palm fruits 5 medium size scotch bonnets Ground chilli pepper 2 big onions Salt 2 cubes of seasoning Chicken/Meat/Fish Ground banga soup spice (optional,)How to choose the right palm fruits: In southern Nigeria, there are two main specie of palm fruits. (those am familiar with)    Native palm fruits: this specie has smaller seeds and a thin cover.   The best way to identify them is to pick up a seed and pierce it with your finger or a semi sharp object. The cover is very thin and your nails would get to the seed quickly.   When used to prepare banga soup, this variety is sweeter but lighter.     Agric palm fruits (Local name) : this one has larger seeds and a thick cover. When pierced, it has more juice flowing out and the inner seed is placed deeper.  If you cook banga soup with this variety, it will come out very thick but lacking in taste. No matter how much ingredient you add, it will come out tasteless. Most people combine both, 70 percent native palm fruits and 30 percent agric palm fruits. I also use only native palm fruits as I don’t like a thick banga soup.  If these names are not familiar, you can identify them by their features.  Make sure to buy fresh palm fruits. Preparation: Wash the Banga fruits and put in a pot. Blend the scotch bonnets with one whole onion. Wash and boil meat with salt, some chopped onion, and one seasoning cube (don’t add too much water, as you won’t be needing meat stock. ). Cooking directions:  Boil Banga seeds on high heat for one hour or until they are tender. (they are ready when you can easily press down on them with your fingers. ) Take off the stove and pour in a sieve to drain out the water.  Transfer to a mortal. (if you don’t have one, you can use a pot or a large bowl(The risk is that they may get damaged with repeated use).  With a pestle, pound the Banga until the skin separates from the seeds.  Add some water and mash with your fingers. ( as you continue, you will notice the water get thicker) Once the juice is thick enough, pour into another bowl( place a sieve on the new bowl to prevent seeds or shafts falling into the juice. )   Repeat this process until you get all juice from the seeds.   Make the juice as thick as possible because when you start cooking, it will get lighter before getting thick again. You don’t want to end up with a watery soup or spend hours cooking.   Place a new sieve on a pot and pour in your Banga juice.  Take out the sieve and place on the stove.  Add your blended scotch bonnets and chilli pepper. (do this immediately you place the pot on the stove, if left to boil without pepper, it will spill over. ) Allow to boil for 20 to 30 minutes, depending on how thick you want your soup to be.    If you are using banga soup spice, add at this stage.     Leave to boil for 5 or 10 minutes, Add your meat, Salt, and one seasoning cube. If you have some chopped onion left, you can add them now,   Boil for another 10 minutes, stir and take off the stove. Your banga soup is ready. Serve with any swallow of your choice.  If you have been cooking this soup for a long time and it’s taking forever to get as thick as you want, serve a small portion and Cook in a smaller pot.  Banga soup gets thicker with time, it will be much thicker if allowed to stay until the next day. "

It can be taken on it’s own on a cold day, enjoyed with a bottle of your favorite chilled drink on a night out with friends, served over a hot plate of white rice or eaten with any swallow of your choice.

(use more or less) Salt.  1 very small onion(optional) 2 cubes of seasoning.  1/4 cup of ground crayfish.  Goat meat. For the best experience combine the fleshy part with assorted. Preparation.  Break open the calabash nutmegs and take out the seeds. Throw away the shell and keep the seeds.  Open the grains of Selim by lightly crushing it with a pestle or any other hard object and take out the seeds. For this, throw away the seeds and keep the back.  Crush both the calabash nutmeg (seeds) and grains of selim (back) together until it comes out in powdered form. Some people lightly burn the calabash nutmeg before crushing. I do not and I find it OK. You could try both ways and see which you prefer.  Wash your goat meat and place in a pot. Add some salt and one cube of seasoning and place on a stove. Cook on high heat until tender. If you notice I did not mention adding onions while cooking the meat, this is because the taste of onion interfere with that of your spices ( especially the grains of Selim), giving it a funny taste.  But if you must add onion while cooking your meat, you can add a little. Cooking directions. :  Once your goat meat is ready, add your crushed spices, chilli pepper and ground crayfish.  Add more water if needed.  Allow to boil for 1o minutes.  Add your salt and seasoning. Allow to boil for an another 10 minutes or until you get the consistency you desire.

Goat meat.  1/4 crayfish.  Salt.  2 seasoning cubes. Preparations. :    In a blender, blend together your scotch bonnets and onions and set aside.   You can either use chilli pepper or scotch bonnets or both. Choose the quantity you want depending on how hot you want your Pepper soup to be.   Break your calabash nutmegs and remove their seeds. Thereafter crush to powder. Before crushing the seeds you can lightly roast them with fire. It gives your soup a distinct aroma. I do not bother doing this but you might like it.  Wash and cut your scent leaves into small pieces.  Wash and place your meat in a pot, add salt,onions and one seasoning cube and cook until tender. Cooking directions. :  To your boiling pot of meat (already tender),add your crushed calabash nutmeg, Pepper and onion puree, chilli pepper and ground crayfish.  Cover and leave to boil for 10 minutes.  Add your Salt, scent leaves and seasoning cube. Allow to boil for another 10 minutes or until you get your desired consistency.

(Ugwu)     Meat and or fish(dry).     1/4 ground cray fish (optional)     Prawns, dried (optional)     4 small scotch bonnets.     1 tbs ground chilli pepper.     1 medium size onion. (choped)     2 seasoning cubes.     Salt.  Preparation. :  Grate or cut the okra into small pieces with a knife. To cut with a knife, cut off the tip of the okra, then make vertical lines down the middle and sides, before cutting vertically. This will give you really small pieces of okra.    Wash the fish. If you are using slightly dried fish then you can wash with cool waterbut if using fish that has been smoked for a long time, then it’s best to wash with hot water.   What happens if I only have fresh fish ?   If you only have Fresh fish, you can fry before using or you can use only meat. Some people prepare okra with fresh fish, personaly, I am not fan.   Wash and cut your vegetables into tiny pieces.  Blend the scotch bonnets and onion together and set aside. Cooking directions. :  Wash the meat in a pot, add onion, Salt and one cube of seasoning. Stir, cover and set on the stove. Do not add water at this stage. Meat has its own water. Allow to boil for about 10 minutes or when you notice that the water from the meat is getting dry. Add more water and continue cooking until the meat is tender.  Pour in your grated or sliced okra, stir well and bring to boil.  Add the palm oil and cover the pot, leave a portion openso the okra does not spill over. Allow to Cook for 10 minutes. for 5 minutes.

    "title": "How To Prepare  Beans in Three Different Ways (Plain, Stewed and Beans Soup",
    "body": "2021/10/12 - Beans are a highly nutritious meal that comes in various sizes and colours. It can also be prepared in many different ways. All unique and delicious. Here are three different ways to prepare beans that you can try today. White or plain beans. : White or plain beans can be enjoyed as an accompaniment with food like rice, dodo(fried plantain), yam etc, all served with stew or as a base for many other beans recipes. Ingredients:    Three cups of beans.     Salt.  Preparation:    Cleaning beans. Beans are notorious for coming packaged together with small stones and debris, even pre-packaged dried beans are no exception. So you want to clean them properly before cooking.   How to clean beans.   Nothing kills your appetite faster than when you have to chew on stones while eating beans.  Here are two ways to ensure your beans is debris free.   Method 1.   Pour the beans into a tray and spread out the beans. Doing this would let you see stones and debris mixed with the beans.   You can either start picking up the beans in a bowl leaving the debris behind or start swiping the debris to a corner of the tray and the beans in the opposite direction. Whichever you choose will leave you with stone-free beans.   Method 2.   Pour the beans into a big bowl and add a lot of water. Scoop up some beans, keeping a little space between your fingers( open enough to let debris and stones pass through but close enough to let the scooped beans remain in your hand. ) and swirl your hand across in the water for a few seconds.   This will let any debris you picked up together with the beans fall back into the water and you will be left with clean beans.   Place this in another bowl and repeat this process until all the beans come out clean. To be extra sure, you should repeat the entire process.     Soak the beans overnight.   Soaking your beans is optional. While some people like beans that were soaked before cooking, others cannot stand them. So this step is up to you. More often than not I soak my beans before cooking because it gets ready faster and has a texture that is difficult to get without soaking.     Wash the beans and put them in a pot.   Use à big enough pot because you will need to cook the beans with a lot of water. Pour enough water to cover the beans and then some.  Cooking directions. :    Turn your stove to medium heat and place the pot of beans on the fire. Bring to boiland allow to Cook for about five minutes. Bring down the pot and pour the beans into a sieve. Strain out all water and place it back into the pot. Why?   Doing this is believed to help get rid of any chemicals that might have been used while storing the beans. It is believed to help relieve the slight heartburn some people feel just after eating beans. Removing the first water when you start cooking is optional, you can continue the process without doing this.     Add water to the beans and cook on low heat. Add enough water. Let the water you use be double the amount of beans in the pot. This much water combined with the low heat would let your beans Cook faster and give you the perfect texture.     Allow your beans to simmer for about an hour and check to see if it is almost ready. Add salt and cover for about 15 minutes or until you are satisfied and your white beans are ready. Serve with rice, dodo, yam all mixed with stew.  Note. If you want to serve as an accompaniment to other foods, it is best cooked until most of the water is dried out. If your beans are ready but still contain a lot of water, pour it into a sieve and strain out. Then put it back on the fire for about a minute l.  If you are preparing as a base to other beans recipes, then leave plenty of water at this stage. Stewed beans. (Nigerian/African Style): Stewed beans is a particular favourite in many Nigerian/African homes. It is so delicious, you don’t want to miss it. Ingrédients:    Beans( as cooked above) -  3 cups.     Cooking oil, (vegetable, sunflower, soya etc) or palm oil.     Crayfish. (optional)     Tomato (optional)     Four small scotch bonnets.     Ground chilli pepper ( half tablespoon. Use more if desired)     1 large onion (chopped. )     Salt     1 or two cubes of seasoning of your choice.  Preparation. : Blend the tomato, scotch bonnets, onion and crayfish with as little water as possible and set aside. Cooking directions. :    Place a dry pot on the stove, set to medium heat and add your vegetable or palm oil. If you are using vegetable oil, allow the oil to heat up enough that it sizzles when you add a pinch of salt or some chopped onion into it.   If you are using palm oil, leave it on fire a bit longer before adding anything. Allow the oil to turn from a cloudy red to a light brown, then add your chopped onion.     Add your chopped onion and allow to fry untilthe colour turns a golden brown.   Immediately add the tomato, pepper, onion and crayfish mix you earlier blended and stir well with a spatula.     Allow frying for about 5 minutes while stirring occasionally. After 5 minutes add salt and any seasoning of your choice.   Leave to fry until all the water you used for blending has evaporated. Take off the stove and mix well with your beans.     Place the Beans on fire and Cook at medium heat. Check to see if there is enough water left in your beans from when you earlier cooked them. If it is them cover and leave to boil.  If your beans are a little dry, you can add a bit more water. Not too much, you want to have a nice enough broth but don’t want to end up with watery beans.  Allow to boil for 5 minutes and check to see if you need to adjust your seasoning. If you don’t, then stir the content of the pot and leave it to boil for another 10 to 15 minutes. And your stewed beans are ready. Serve and eat with bread, dodo(fried plantain), yam, etc. Note. When you start stewing the beans, stir at intervals. This prevents the beans from sticking to the end of your pot. Also always use a spatula. Bean soup. ( Nigerian/African style): Once your beans are ready, making bean soup is very easy to prepare yet delicious. Ingrédients:    Beans( Cooked as no 1 above), 3 cups     Palm oil 1/2 cup     Chilli pepper     Dry fish.     Grains of Selim - 1 medium size.     Crayfish(ground)     Salt.     I cube of any seasoning of your choice.  Preparation. : Pound the grains of Selim slightly until it opens up and take out all seeds. Note that taking out the seed is optional because I have seen people use it whole. I take the seeds out because when used whole it comes with a bitter taste that I am not a fan of. So take out the seeds and pound together with the crayfish until smooth. Clean and wash your fish. Then cut into small pieces. Cooking directions. :  Place your pot of beans( already cooked) on the stove at medium heat make sure you have enough water left in the beans. You don’t want it dry.  Allow to boil then add all ingredients ( chilli, fish, grains of Selim, crayfish and palm oil) except your salt and Maggi cube. Stir and cover. You must add your palm oil early, so it cooks properly. Palm oil that is not properly cooked will leave you with a sticky, funny taste. You don’t want that.  After ten minutes, check for Salt. Add more if needed and add your Maggi cube.  Leave to boil for another ten to fifteenminutes. Your beans soup is ready. Before serving, stir well to ensure all the content of your pot mixes well and you are not left out of any goodies when you take a scoop. Note. Do not Cook until dry. These beans need to have enough soup in them. you can eat it with any swallow of your choice. Eba, Semo, Nshima, Ugali etc. "

      <li>The moi-moi texture you want to achieve is one where the mixture is neither too thick nor too light.</li>
      <li>If you don’t have warm water, it’s okay to use cool water, especially if the Moi-Moi quantity is not much.</li>
      <li>Do not use hot water as it will cause the  paste to become lumpy.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Serve small quantity of Moi-Moi paste into any container of your choice. Repeat this process until all the moi moi has been served.</p>

    <p><strong>Tip</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you are not used to cooking with leaves, it’s best to use aluminum or plastic cups. Once leaves are not folded properly, they can unravel.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Into every container of moi moi, add the filling of your choice. (boiled egg, fish etc)

<h2 id="cooking-directions">Cooking directions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Pour some water in a large pot, and place the cups of moi-moi.
Don’t put too much water in the pot, so it does not boil over into the moi-moi when cooking.</li>
  <li>Cover the pot and cook for an hour. While your moi -moi is cooking, open the pot every 10 to 15 minutes and add little quantity of water whenever you notice the water is drying out. This will prevent the Moi-Moi from getting burned.</li>
  <li>Taste to see if your moi-moi is fully cooked. To confirm if your moi moi is ready, either cut out a piece and taste or pierce the inside with a dry object. If it comes out clean, it’s properly cooked.</li>
  <li>Continue cooking for a few more minutes if it’s not properly cooked and take off the fire if and when they are.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>*<em>Note.</em></strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Before you start cooking, taste the moi moi to be sure there is nothing else you are missing. Once you start cooking you cannot add anything else.</li>
  <li>If you are using plastic bags, double and tie them well. This will prevent water from getting inside if one of the bags has a hole you didn’t see.</li>
  <li>When using any container that is plastic, top up the water in the cooking pot frequently.</li>
  <li>If the water gets too low, there is a risk of the containers getting burnt.</li>
  <li>Avoid using banana or plantain leaves to cook if you are not confident you know how to use them.
They can unravel quickly and spoil your efforts if they are not well folded.
If you feel you know how to  but still have some doubts, then tie each of them with a small rope after folding. It will help keep them together.</li>
